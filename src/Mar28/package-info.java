//Data structures intro

//Linear data structures -
// elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all
// elements sequentially (lists, stacks, queues)


//Non-linear data structures -
//Elements of this structure are accessed in a non-linear order (trees and graphs)

//Abstract data types vs real data structures
//Abstract data types are abstractions of a data structure which provide only the interface to which a
//data structure must adhere to

//The interface does not give any specific details about the implementation of the data structure

//Collections and Containers

//A collection is simply a memory object that groups multiple elements into a single unit
//Collections are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, as well as transmit data from one method to another
//(Arrays, hashtables, vectors, sets, maps, trees)

//Interfaces form the Java Collections framework
